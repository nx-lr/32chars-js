The idea for this universe sparked about six years ago in the high school cafeteria. One day as me and my friend Phillip were discussing our favorite shows and comics, he proposed that we pitch ideas for our own animated show. We settled on a sci-fi universe since we both liked Star Wars and Mass Effect. Phillip wrote the key points for our story while I created some character concepts in my head. Never in years would I think that I will be making a book dedicated to this world and characters. Although the story was never finished, it will forever remain in my heart and remind me of all the great memories that I got to share with Phillip.

R.A.H MOB was one of the few things that made me happy for the past few years, it allowed me to escape from my problems and expand my creativity. This artbook is a piece of me which I would have never thought that I would be able to share with people. The story shows the adventure of a human boy becoming one of the earth’s military best soldiers and galaxy MOB’s, with help of a machine and alien mentoring him.

I am beyond excited for my family, friends, teachers, classmates, and strangers to see what I’ve been working on for the past one and a half years. This project wouldn’t be possible without Phillip who helped me get out of my comfort zone, spark my creativity, and being an amazing friend. My family who helped me mentally and financially for the last months so that I could work exclusively on this book. Alex who I met on social media a while ago who always supported and believed in me and many other people.
